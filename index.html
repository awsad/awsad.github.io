        The main goal of this project is to allow the team to become proficient in topics related to the scope of the global pricing and analytics team.
        For us, that is mainly learning new statistical analysis techniques and topics in data science and machine learning. <br>
        At this stage I have done very little regarding continuous improvement as it seems that there is always something else to do. However, I
        am enrolled in the following classes with edX, a Microsoft backed online learning website.
